How to install openpyxl:

Please make sure you have pip installed on your system(pip is pre-installed with Python 2.7.12 and above)

Step 1:  
To check if pip is installed, go to the folder - 'Python27' is, check for a folder named 'Scripts' in the Python folder. In 'Scripts', there must be 6 files with one file named pip.
If so, copy paste the .tar file into the Scripts folder and proceed to the next step.
If not, then it may not be possible to install openpyxl using pip. The best solution to this problem is to re-install a new version of Python(preferably version 2.7.12 as it is the version which was used in the making of this project).

Step 2:
Open command prompt. Change the directory to the Scripts folder by typing the following command:
                              chdir ......\Python27\Scripts
where ........ denotes the path of the Python27 folder

Step 3:
Now type the following command in the Command Prompt window:
                                      pip install openpyxl
This must install all the necessary files for the module


Now with openpyxl installed, it would be possible to view our project as it is.
